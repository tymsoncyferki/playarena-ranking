# Playarena ranking

A small Flask app aimed to create a ranking of players from Playarena (on the official site a player's rank can only be found on the profile of that particular player). Unfortunately, it turned out that the ranking does not make sense - multiple players have the same rank and many positions are missing. Due to these issues, I decided to abandon further development of this app.
